## 🚀 How to Use

### Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Verify system is ready
python quick_start.py

# 2. Launch the dashboard
marimo run dashboard.py

# 3. In the dashboard:
#    - Scan for devices
#    - Select and connect
#    - Start recording
#    - Add events as needed
#    - Stop to save
```

### Key Features Delivered

1. **Continuous Recording**: Can record for hours without memory issues
2. **Automatic Saves**: Data saved every 5 minutes and on stop
3. **Event Annotation**: Add timestamped events during recording
4. **Real-time Monitoring**: Live plots of all ML scores
5. **System Integration**: Timestamps for alignment with other processes
6. **Professional UI**: Clean Marimo dashboard with all controls

## 💾 Data Access

After recording, your data is available in:
- `data/session_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/session_data.h5` - All sensor and ML data
- `data/session_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/events.json` - Annotated events
- `data/session_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/session_info.json` - Session metadata

## 🔧 Customization

Edit `config.py` to adjust:
- Buffer sizes
- Save intervals
- Display windows
- Update frequencies
- File compression
